Why is printing `Hello, World!` the first program every programmer is taught?

How did those two words become the universal standard for teaching programming languages? 

It is the easiest thing you could do, but it barely aligns with anyone's original reason of wanting to learn to code.

So why don't we make it more personal and aimed straight to the heart.

People have different reasons for learning to program. It could be to automate the boring stuff, to generate new insights from giga-pools of data,
 or to create an app for your sports team. 

Personally, just got tired of waiting for someone else to build things I need.

That's why I want continue to create, learn and listen to people's problems and find a solution.

print('Just Do It.')
